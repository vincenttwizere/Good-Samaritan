# Good Samaritan

**Good Samaritan** is a charity web project aimed at creating a better world by connecting those with resources to those in need. The platform allows users to make donations and facilitates the collection of surplus food from hotels and restaurants. Instead of wasting food, we redirect it to those who need it most — protecting people and the environment.
